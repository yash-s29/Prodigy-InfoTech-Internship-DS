# Task 01: Population Distribution Analysis

Problem Statement: Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

Objective: Understand the demographic spread within a dataset.

Key Visuals: Age distribution histograms and gender-based bar charts.

Insights: Identified predominant age groups and gender ratios.

# Task 02: Titanic EDA & Data Cleaning

Problem Statement: Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns.

Objective: Clean messy data and find correlations between features like Class, Sex, Age, and Survival.

Steps: Handled missing values (Age/Cabin), feature engineering, and survival rate analysis.

Findings: Higher survival rates observed among females and first-class passengers.

# Task 03: Customer Purchase Prediction

Problem Statement: Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data.

Objective: Use the Bank Marketing dataset (UCI) to build a predictive model.

Model: Decision Tree Classifier with hyperparameter tuning.

Results: Achieved an accuracy of X% (insert your accuracy) in predicting subscription success.

# Task 04: Social Media Sentiment Analysis

Problem Statement: Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion towards specific topics or brands.

Objective: Categorize social media posts into Positive, Negative, and Neutral sentiments.

Approach: Text preprocessing (Natural Language Processing) followed by sentiment scoring and word cloud visualization.

Visuals: Sentiment distribution pie charts and keyword word clouds.

# Task 05: Traffic Accident Data Analysis

Problem Statement: Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day.

Objective: Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors to improve road safety.

Key Metrics: Accidents vs. Weather conditions, peak accident hours, and hotspot mapping.

Insights: Identified that most accidents occur during [insert time/condition, e.g., evening rush hour under rainy conditions].
